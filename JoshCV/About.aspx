                                I am self taught mostly, however I have picked up a lot of skills 
                                from my time working closely with advanced developers. 
                                I have theoretical knowledge of Javascript and I understand the

                                I have provided training for a large number of colleagues of various standings within the Council. 
                                The colleagues I have trained range from new apprentices to high level managers with large influence 
                                within the organisation. This has enabled me to develop sharp communication skills and to adapt the way
                                I explain and discuss various subjects to best match the person I am talking with.

                            I have held the role of being the first point of contact within my previous team. Often, my colleagues would 
                            forward their phones to my phone in order for me to prioritise the requests which we receive. I also held the 
                            responsibility of maintaining the team inbox, I helped my team by allocating tasks to the most appropriate person 
                            in the team for each task. These roles have taught me to manage not only my own workload, but to assist my 
                            colleagues in managing their tasks. I have also learnt to work under pressure from these roles, as I am often 
                            required to provide quick fixes to issues that my colleagues and customers have encountered.

                            Provided training to colleagues on how to use our content management system (CMS) - Jadu. This has 
                            enabled me to develop versatile communication skills, allowing me to change the way I talk to communicate as effectively 
                            as possible to my colleagues.

                            I provide monthly and weekly reports on web page statistics, detailing the sources of pageviews, the URL's used and the 
                            type of devices used to access web pages. (Google Analytics). I also provide monthly statistics which details the income 
                            gained from our web forms to the Service Delivery Manager of Customer Services. The result of this has enabled me to develop 
                            good organisation skills and managing data effectively.

                            I have a lot of experience working on projects, I am often responsible for chasing colleagues, requesting them to provide 
                            content and multimedia items in order to complete web pages and websites. I also played a large part in the migration of our 
                            previous council website to the new, responsive website. I also have experience managing projects, I have taken a central role 
                            in the project of converting all current PDF forms to online web forms. This has taught me to be persistent and determined, 
                            I have also had to use the good communication skills I have developed in order to obtain the information I require in time to 
                            meet deadlines.
